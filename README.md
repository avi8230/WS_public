# Project's Website - WordStorage.com

This website represents a significant project I have developed to date. It serves as a tool for learning any language the user chooses to study.

The site enables users to store words in a personal database, including associated sentences and images related to each word. It features an area for word learning, including listening to words and sentences saved on the site, as well as a section for testing knowledge of the words.
